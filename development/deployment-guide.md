# Deployment Guide – Tender Insight Hub

## 1. Overview

This guide explains how to deploy the Tender Insight Hub platform to a production environment using containerization and cloud services.


## 2. Prerequisites

- Access to cloud provider (Render, Heroku, GCP, AWS, Azure)  
- Docker & Docker Compose installed locally  
- Kubernetes knowledge (optional for orchestration)  
- Proper environment variables and secrets management  


## 3. Infrastructure Setup

- Provision managed PostgreSQL and MongoDB/Redis services.  
- Setup domain and configure DNS with SSL certificates (via Let’s Encrypt or provider).  
- Setup load balancers and reverse proxies (e.g., NGINX).


## 4. Build and Push Docker Images

```bash
docker build -t tender-insight-backend ./backend
docker build -t tender-insight-frontend ./frontend
docker tag tender-insight-backend skosanakhethiwe/tender-insight-backend:latest
docker tag tender-insight-frontend skosanakhethiwe/tender-insight-frontend:latest
docker push skosanakhethiwe/tender-insight-backend:latest
docker push skosanakhethiwe/tender-insight-frontend:latest


## 5. Deployment Steps
Deploy containers via Kubernetes, Docker Compose, or platform-specific workflows.
Run database migrations:

alembic upgrade head

Configure environment variables securely on the server.
Start backend service with a production-ready ASGI server (Gunicorn + Uvicorn workers).
Serve frontend static files or run the frontend server.

## 6. Monitoring & Logging
Setup centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack or cloud logging service).
Use Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring metrics and alerts.
Enable health checks and auto-restart policies.

## 7. Security Best Practices
Enforce HTTPS everywhere.
Secure environment variables and secret storage.
Regularly rotate JWT secret keys.
Use firewalls and restrict access to databases.

## 8. Rollback Strategy
Tag releases in version control and container registry.
Maintain database backups before each deployment.
Ability to redeploy last stable containers quickly if needed.

## 9. Post-Deployment Validation
Run smoke tests to verify deployment integrity.
Confirm SSL certificates are valid.
Check API health endpoints and frontend accessibility.

## 10. Maintenance & Updates
Schedule regular dependency updates and security patches.
Monitor performance and scale infrastructure as needed.
Continuously review logs and error reports.
