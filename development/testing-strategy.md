# Testing Strategy â€“ Tender Insight Hub

## 1. Introduction

Testing is vital to maintain code quality and ensure the platform works reliably for all users. This document outlines our testing philosophy, methodologies, and tools.


## 2. Testing Objectives

- Validate correctness of all system components.  
- Detect bugs early in development.  
- Verify security and access controls.  
- Ensure performance and scalability under load.


## 3. Testing Types

### 3.1 Unit Tests  
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation.  
- Mock external dependencies where necessary.  
- Framework: `pytest` for backend, `Jest` for frontend.

### 3.2 Integration Tests  
- Verify interaction between components, such as API endpoints and databases.  
- Test multi-tenant authorization and data segregation.  

### 3.3 End-to-End (E2E) Tests  
- Simulate real user scenarios across the entire stack.  
- Tooling: `Cypress` or `Playwright`.  
- Examples: User login, tender search, tender save, report export.

### 3.4 Performance Testing  
- Measure latency, throughput, and error rates.  
- Tools: `Locust` or `k6`.  
- Identify bottlenecks under high concurrency.

### 3.5 Security Testing  
- Conduct automated and manual checks for injection, XSS, CSRF, and authentication flaws.  
- Utilize OWASP guidelines and vulnerability scanners.


## 4. Testing Tools

| Layer       | Tools & Frameworks                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Backend     | pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx, unittest.mock|
| Frontend    | Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress        |
| CI/CD       | GitHub Actions (runs tests & coverage)     |
| Performance | Locust, k6                                  |
| Security    | OWASP ZAP, Bandit                           |


## 5. Test Data Management

- Use separate test databases for isolation.  
- Seed with realistic sample data for tenders, profiles, and users.  
- Use fixtures for consistent test setups.


## 6. Continuous Integration

- All tests run on every pull request.  
- Block merging if tests fail or coverage drops below 85%.  
- Automated linting and security scans included in pipeline.


## 7. Reporting & Metrics

- Generate and publish coverage reports (HTML format).  
- Track flaky tests and reduce over time.  
- Log AI summarization accuracy and failure cases for review.

---

## 8. Best Practices

- Keep tests fast and focused.  
- Write clear and descriptive test names.  
- Avoid test inter-dependencies.  
- Continuously update tests as features evolve.
